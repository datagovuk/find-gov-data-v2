More recent data, for 2015, has now been published as part of Ofcom's Connected Nations Report (previously called Infrastructure Report), available on this site and on Ofcom's website at http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/market-data/infrastructure/?a=0.  The data are available at postcode level (zip file) and at local authority level (csv file).\r\n\r\nThese datasets show information on broadband take-up, speeds and availability. They are produced by Ofcom and contain data provided to Ofcom by communications providers.\r\n\r\nA key to the numbers in the 2012 dataset is below: \r\n\r\nAverage modem sync speed (Mbit/s)\r\nThe average maximum speeds of existing broadband connections. Speeds achieved in the home will be slower.\r\nAverage modem sync speed score\r\nEach area has been ranked from 1 to 5 on the average modem sync speed which is the average maximum speed of existing broadband connections.\r\n\r\n1= 16Mbit/s or faster \r\n\r\n2= 10Mbit/s - slower than 16Mbit/s \r\n\r\n3= 8Mbit/s - slower than 10Mbit/s \r\n\r\n4= 6Mbit/s - slower than 8Mbit/s \r\n\r\n5= slower than 6Mbit/s \r\n\r\n\r\nPercentage receiving less than 2Mbit/s\r\nThe percentage of homes with broadband currently not achieving 2Mbit/s speeds.\r\nPercentage receiving less than 2Mbit/s score\r\nEach area has been ranked from 1 to 5 on the percentage of homes with broadband currently not achieving 2Mbit/s.\r\n\r\n1= less than 5% \r\n\r\n2= 5% - less than 10% \r\n\r\n3= 10% - less than 15% \r\n\r\n4= 15% - less than 20% \r\n\r\n5= 20% or more \r\n\r\nSuperfast availability\r\nThe percentage of addresses which are within the coverage area of superfast (over 24Mbit/s) broadband networks.\r\n\r\nSuperfast availability score\r\nEach area has been ranked from 1 to 5 on the percentage of addresses which are within the coverage area of superfast (over 24mbit/s) broadband networks.\r\n\r\n1= 90% availability or more \r\n\r\n2= 70% - less than 90% \r\n\r\n3= 50% - less than 70% \r\n\r\n4= 30% - less than 50% \r\n\r\n5= less than 30% \r\n\r\nAverage take-up\r\nThe number of existing broadband connections as a proportion of premises, excluding superfast broadband connections.\r\nAverage take-up score\r\nEach area has been ranked from 1 to 5 on the number of existing broadband connections as a proportion of premises.\r\n\r\n1= 80% or more \r\n\r\n2= 70% - less than 80% \r\n\r\n3= 60% - less than 70% \r\n\r\n4= 50% - less than 60% \r\n\r\n5= less than 50% \r\nTotal\r\n\r\nEach area has been ranked on how they score on four broadband metrics, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 the highest or fastest, and 5 the lowest or slowest.\r\nThe individual scores have been combined to provide an overall view of broadband in each area.\r\n\r\n1= fewer than 10 points \r\n\r\n2= 10 points - fewer than 12 points \r\n\r\n3= 12 points - fewer than 14 points \r\n\r\n4= 14 points - fewer than 16 points \r\n\r\n5= more than 16 points \r\n",

One such project is to work with Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to improve their broadband speeds. Grants (known as vouchers) are paid to businesses between £100 and £3,000 to help them get better connected. Superfast broadband can among other things, increase business efficiency and productivity and reduce downtime. The Dataset This dataset provides some information about companies who have been successful in applying for a grant. It shows their original upload and download speeds and the improvements they expect to receive. It is recognised that there are some gaps in this dataset, however this information should be populated as the project progresses. Please note Phase 1 of this scheme is now closed and this dataset will no longer be updated.",

Please see our terms of use for our licence conditions, and please refer to the Ofcom website to see the pdf  'About this data' documents.\r\n\r\nHigh quality, widespread communications, fixed and mobile, are an engine of our economy and the pulse of our society. They are not nice-to-haves, but essential enablers of our working and social lives. As businesses and consumers drive an ever-increasing demand for communications, the infrastructure that serves them must keep pace with their demands and needs. \r\n\r\nOne of Ofcom’s roles is to make sure that the UK has the communications infrastructure it requires. This means making services available where people live and work; call connections being clear and robust; and data being down- and up-loaded at speeds that deliver a good experience. Ofcom is also responsible for providing clear, accurate, easy to use information. This equips businesses and consumers to make informed decisions about the services that can serve them best.\r\n\r\nThe Connected Nations Report (previously called the Infrastructure Report) charts the UK’s evolving communications infrastructure, and our progress towards becoming genuinely connected nations.\r\n\r\nWhere we can, we have made the data underlying this year’s report available for download.
